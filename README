* project dev name will be etpaste, which means eternal pastebin server.
  I don't like that the existing paste servers are not maintained. In this
  app, I will setup a build server and do Continuous Build Test against new
  language versions and library versions.

  I want it maintained and tested. Not discarded in dust.
