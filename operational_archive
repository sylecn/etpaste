  - read the pygments document.

    import pygments
    import pygments.lexers
    import pygments.formatters
    pygments.highlight("import foo", pygments.lexers.get_lexer_by_name("py"), pygments.formatters.html.HtmlFormatter())

    works. where are the built-in css for it?

    pygments.formatters.html.HtmlFormatter.get_style_defs

  If type is not set or set to text, auto guess it.

  No. Since guess correct rate is very low, if no type info is given, just
  use raw text. I will not use any guess result.

  pygments.lexers.guess_lexer(_text)

  guess is very weak.
  normal python ==> pygments.lexers.NumPyLexer
  org-mode text with explicit header => pygments.lexers.CLexer

  write a page to guess the language.
  /guess

  guess is very weak. weaker than file command.

  seems only work for text with shabang lines. Not practical at all.
